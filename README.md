# dragonfly-commands
My commands for Dragonfly, an extension to Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

These command modules are intended as a reference supplement to my blog,
[handsfreecoding.org](http://handsfreecoding.org). They are a work in progress,
so expect breaking changes. Currently, many commands are specific to my setup,
so I recommend using this as a source of ideas and examples instead of
directly. If you wish to make it easier for others to use directly, I am open to
a pull request, but please do so in a way that will not slow down development
(i.e. follow the Don't Repeat Yourself principle).

Several of these modules are based on examples from the [official
dragonfly-modules repository](https://github.com/t4ngo/dragonfly-modules).
